# Grace AI Agent Fix Summary - Sept 2, 2025

## Problems Identified in Failed Calls

### Call 1 (Robert - Voicemail):
- **DOUBLE VOICEMAIL**: Grace left TWO messages in the same voicemail recording
- **EMAIL REFERENCE**: Mentioned "reply to the email I sent you" in a voicemail
- **EXCESSIVE LENGTH**: 61 seconds for a voicemail

### Call 2 (Stella - Immediate Hangup):  
- **QUOTE FORMATTING**: Agent literally said quotes at the beginning of speech
- **OVERWHELMING PRODUCT LIST**: Listed every single item with full details
- **ROBOTIC TONE**: Sounded like reading from a script
- **INSTANT HANGUP**: Customer hung up immediately after the long product list

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Voicemail Handling (CRITICAL)
**Before:** Agent would leave multiple messages and continue talking
**After:** 
- Detects voicemail indicators immediately
- Leaves ONE brief message (under 15 seconds)
- Says: "Hey [name], it's Grace from The Meatery. I noticed you were checking out some premium wagyu earlier. Give me a call back if you're still interested. Thanks!"
- Ends call immediately after message

### 2. Product Reference Simplification
**Before:** Listed every item: "1 Japanese A5 Wagyu | Ground Beef, 2 Japanese A5 Wagyu | Denver Steak I BMS 11 | 8oz..."
**After:** Uses general terms: "premium wagyu", "those beautiful steaks", "your selections"

### 3. Agent Configuration Updates
- **Voicemail Detection**: Enabled with 5-second timeout
- **Response Speed**: Increased to 0.98 for faster reactions
- **Begin Message Delay**: Reduced to 1.5 seconds
- **Interruption Sensitivity**: Adjusted to 0.55 for better conversation flow
- **End Call After Silence**: Set to 10 seconds minimum

### 4. Prompt Improvements
- Removed all placeholder text issues
- Simplified product naming conventions
- Added clear voicemail vs live call distinction
- Improved natural conversation flow
- Fixed email reference instructions

## Expected Results

1. **Voicemail Calls**: Single, brief message under 15 seconds
2. **Live Calls**: Natural conversation without overwhelming product lists
3. **Better Success Rate**: Customers won't hang up from information overload
4. **Professional Tone**: More conversational, less robotic

## Testing

Use the `test-grace-fix.js` script to verify the changes:

## Key Reminders

- Grace now says "premium wagyu" instead of listing all products
- Voicemail = ONE message then END
- No quotes or special characters in speech
- Natural, conversational tone throughout
