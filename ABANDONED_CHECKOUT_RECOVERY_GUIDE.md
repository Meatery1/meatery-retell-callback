## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Grace Agent**: Specialized for abandoned checkout recovery (not Nick)
- **Strategic Psychology**: "Was something wrong with the website?" approach
- **Smart Discounting**: Tiered discounts based on customer history
- **Recovery Cart Links**: SMS with discounted cart links (24-hour expiration)
- **Customer Filtering**: Avoids calling recent successful buyers

### Key Psychological Techniques

#### 1. Website Difficulty Questioning
**When**: Customer seems hesitant or says "just browsing"
**Technique**: "Was something wrong with the website? Sometimes people run into issues with the checkout process..."
**Why it works**: Implies their cart was perfect, only technical issues would prevent purchase

#### 2. Strategic Discounting
**New customers**: 10-12% (encourage trial)
**Return customers**: 8-10% (reward interest)  
**Recent customers**: 0-8% (avoid cannibalization)
**Urgency**: "Expires in one day"

#### 3. Recovery Cart Links
- SMS with discounted cart link
- 24-hour expiration
- One-click completion
- Automatic discount application

## ðŸ“Š Call Flow Examples

### Successful Recovery
**Grace**: "Hey John, it's Grace from The Meatery. I noticed you were looking at 2x Wagyu Ribeye, 1x Kurobuta Bacon on our site earlier - did you have any questions about those cuts?"

**Customer**: "Oh yeah, I was looking at that! The ribeye looked amazing but I wasn't sure about the price."

**Grace**: "I hear you! Let me check what I can do to help make this work for you... I can offer you a 12% discount on that order. That'll save you about $23 on those steaks and bacon. Here's the thing though - this discount link expires in one day, so you'll want to use it soon if you're interested."

### Website Difficulty Approach
**Customer**: "I was just looking around."

**Grace**: "Got it. Was something wrong with the website? Sometimes people run into issues with the checkout process or have trouble finding what they're looking for."

**Customer**: "No, it was fine. I just wasn't ready."

**Grace**: "Ah, I see. Well, you had some really nice cuts picked out there. That A5 Wagyu ribeye is one of our bestsellers. Since you had such good taste in picking that out, I can send you a special offer - a recovery link with a discount, but it expires in one day. Want me to send that over?"
