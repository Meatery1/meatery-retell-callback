# Grace Agent Complete Rewrite - Summary

## Problem Addressed
Grace was being "fucking annoying" and not using her tools effectively. She was asking customers if they had tried Wagyu when she could see their purchase history, and the conversation was too long and unfocused.

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ New Focused Prompt
- **Eliminated annoying questions** - No more "Have you tried Wagyu?" to customers with Wagyu history
- **Shortened conversation flow** - 2-3 minute target vs. previous rambling
- **Direct and specific** - Presents exact bundle with exact pricing
- **Respectful but assumptive** - Gets to the point quickly

### 2. ‚úÖ SKU Support Added
- **SKU to Variant ID conversion** - Function added to handle SKU lookups
- **Updated createWinBackDraftOrder** - Now accepts `productSKUs` parameter
- **New endpoint** - `/tools/create-win-back-draft-order` specifically for Grace

### 3. ‚úÖ Specific Bundle Configuration
Grace now pitches this exact bundle:
- Japanese A5 Wagyu Ribeye (16oz) - $128.99 (SKU: P0097S)
- Japanese A5 Wagyu Filet Mignon (8oz) - $144.32 (SKU: P0188S)  
- Australian Wagyu Ribeye (16oz) - $73.99 (SKU: P0159S-2)
- Australian Wagyu Filet Mignon (8oz) - $74.99 (SKU: P0166S)
- **Total retail: $422.29**
- **Grace's price: $337.83 (20% off)**

### 4. ‚úÖ Agent Settings Optimized
- **Voice temperature**: 0.3 (more consistent)
- **Voice speed**: 1.0 (normal pace)
- **Responsiveness**: 0.85 (quick but measured)
- **Interruption sensitivity**: 0.8 (less likely to interrupt)
- **Better backchannel words**: ["Got it", "I see", "Right", "Absolutely", "Perfect"]

### 5. ‚úÖ Conversation Flow Redesigned

**Opening (30 seconds max):**
```
"Hey {{customer_name}}, it's Grace from The Meatery. How have you been doing?"
[Brief response]
"I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I noticed it's been a bit since your last order, so I wanted to reach out. What have you been cooking lately?"
```

**The Pitch (45 seconds max):**
```
"Perfect timing actually - I pulled up your account and I can see you're one of our Wagyu enthusiasts. I've put together an exclusive bundle that I think you'll love, and I can only hold it for today.

Here's what I've selected for you:
- Japanese A5 Wagyu Ribeye, 16 ounces
- Japanese A5 Wagyu Filet Mignon, 8 ounces  
- Australian Wagyu Ribeye, 16 ounces
- Australian Wagyu Filet Mignon, 8 ounces

That's normally $422, but I can do it for $338 - that's 20% off. Should I reserve this for you?"
```

**Close (15 seconds max):**
```
"Perfect! I'll create that order for you right now and text you the checkout link."
```

### 6. ‚úÖ Technical Implementation
- **SKU conversion function** - Converts SKUs to Shopify variant IDs
- **Updated draft order creation** - Handles both variant IDs and SKUs
- **New tool endpoint** - Specifically for Grace's bundle creation
- **Tested and working** - Successfully created draft order with $278.64 total (20% off applied)
