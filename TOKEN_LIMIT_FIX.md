# Token Limit Fix - October 6, 2025

## Problem
The automated improvement system was encountering a 429 error from OpenAI:
```
Error: 429 Request too large for gpt-4o in organization
Limit: 450,000 tokens per minute
Requested: 1,629,542 tokens
```

The system was trying to send 1.6M tokens in a single request, which exceeded the rate limit by over 3.6x.

## Root Cause
The `prompt-improvement-loop.js` had several issues causing token overload:

1. **Full Transcript Fetching**: `ANALYZE_FULL_TRANSCRIPTS: true` was fetching complete transcripts for EVERY call in the last 24 hours
2. **No Call Sampling**: All calls (potentially 100+ per day) were being analyzed without limit
3. **Unlimited Positive Examples**: All successful calls with full transcripts were being sent to OpenAI
4. **Large Prompt Data**: The entire current prompt, all previous issues, and all call data was being sent
5. **No Token Estimation**: No safeguards to detect oversized requests before sending

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Disabled Full Transcript Fetching
```javascript
ANALYZE_FULL_TRANSCRIPTS: false, // FIXED: Don't fetch full transcripts to avoid token limit
```

### 2. Added Call Sampling (Max 50 calls)
```javascript
MAX_CALLS_FOR_ANALYSIS: 50, // Maximum calls to deeply analyze (sample from larger set)
```

Sampling prioritizes:
- All failed calls (up to 30)
- Sample of successful calls (to fill remaining slots)

### 3. Limited Positive Examples (Max 10, only send 5 to OpenAI)
```javascript
if (transcript.length > 200 && !call.call_analysis?.in_voicemail && analysis.positive_examples.length < 10)
```

### 4. Truncated Transcript Excerpts
```javascript
MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS: 500, // Maximum characters per transcript excerpt
transcript_excerpt: transcript.substring(0, CONFIG.MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS)
```

### 5. Reduced Data Sent to OpenAI
- Current prompt: Limited to 4,000 characters
- New issues: Max 20
- Unhandled requests: Max 20
- Edge cases: Max 10
- Positive examples: Max 5

### 6. Added Token Estimation & Safety Guards
```javascript
function estimateTokens(text) {
  return Math.ceil(text.length / 4);
}

// Log estimated tokens before sending
const estimatedTokens = estimateTokens(improvementPrompt);
console.log(`üìä Estimated tokens for OpenAI request: ${estimatedTokens.toLocaleString()}`);

// Block requests over 400K tokens
if (estimatedTokens > 400000) {
  console.error('‚ùå ERROR: Estimated token count exceeds safe limit');
  return { /* empty improvements */ };
}
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Attempting to send: **~1,629,542 tokens** (3.6x over limit)
- Result: **429 error** - analysis completely failed

### After Fix
- Estimated tokens: **~50,000-100,000 tokens** (well under 450K limit)
- Result: **‚úÖ Analysis runs successfully**

## Token Reduction Breakdown

| Component | Before | After | Savings |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Full transcripts | ~1,200,000 | ~25,000 | 1,175,000 |
| Current prompt | ~20,000 | ~4,000 | 16,000 |
| Call samples | Unlimited | Max 50 calls | Variable |
| Positive examples | All calls | Max 5 excerpts | ~100,000 |
| **Total Estimate** | **~1,629,542** | **~50,000-100,000** | **~1,529,542** |

## Safety Margin
The fix includes multiple layers of protection:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning at 100K tokens
2. ‚ùå Block at 400K tokens (with 50K safety margin below the 450K limit)
3. Smart sampling prioritizes important calls
4. Graceful degradation (returns empty improvements rather than crashing)

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Fix has been applied
2. Monitor the next scheduled run (10/7/2025, 3:04:10 AM)
3. Verify token counts in logs
4. Confirm successful analysis without 429 errors

## Testing the Fix
To manually test the improved system:
```bash
cd /Users/nickyfiorentino/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Retell\ AI/meatery-retell-callback
node src/prompt-improvement-loop.js
```

You should see output like:
```
üìä Estimated tokens for OpenAI request: 75,234
‚úÖ Analysis complete
```

Instead of:
```
‚ùå Error: 429 Request too large
```

## Performance Impact
The fix should have **minimal impact** on analysis quality:
- Still analyzes up to 50 calls (plenty for daily patterns)
- Prioritizes failed calls (where issues are found)
- Maintains 500 chars of transcript context (enough for pattern detection)
- Keeps best practices and sample scripts functionality intact

The key insight: **You don't need to analyze 100% of calls to find patterns** - a well-sampled subset is sufficient and much more efficient.
