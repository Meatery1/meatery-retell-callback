# Grace Script Updates - Direct & Action-Oriented

## What Changed After Call Review (call_bb068e25ff39baba8813765cff2)

### Problems Identified:
1. **Too Verbose**: "that's just the beginning—let me tell you what you've been missing" (unnecessary)
2. **Asking Permission**: "Mind if I take a quick peek?" (just do it!)
3. **Vague Offers**: "grab a few ribeyes, some burger patties" (no specifics)
4. **Lost the Close**: Customer asked "How does it work?" and she started explaining steps instead of sending the link
5. **Customer Hung Up**: While she was still talking!

## New Approach: DIRECT & SPECIFIC

### Example of OLD vs NEW:

**OLD (Too Verbose):**
"So here's the deal—we've been missing you, and I'm authorized to do something special for our best customers. We're talking 20% off when you stock up with $200 or more. But honestly, that's just the beginning—let me tell you what you've been missing..."

**NEW (Direct):**
"Perfect. I'm looking at your account now... Okay, based on what you've ordered before, I can do 20% off if you stock up with $200 or more today. Here's what I'd suggest: 2 Australian Wagyu Ribeyes at $65 each, plus 3 pounds of Wagyu burger blend at $25 per pound. That's $205, but with 20% off you'd pay just $164. I can text you a checkout link right now. Sound good?"

## Key Script Changes:

### 1. NO MORE ASKING PERMISSION
- ❌ "Mind if I look at your past orders?"
- ✅ "I'm looking at your account now..." [already doing it]

### 2. SPECIFIC OFFERS WITH EXACT MATH
- ❌ "You could grab a few ribeyes and some burgers"
- ✅ "2 Wagyu Ribeyes at $65 each, plus 3 pounds of burger at $25/pound = $205, drops to $164 with discount"

### 3. IMMEDIATE ACTION
- ❌ "Here's how it works: Step 1..."
- ✅ "I'll text you the link right now. What's your number?"

### 4. CLOSE AT FIRST INTEREST
When customer says "How does it work?" or shows ANY interest:
- Don't explain the process
- Just say: "Super simple - I'll text you a link with everything in your cart and the discount applied. Takes 30 seconds. What number should I use?"

## The New Flow (2 Minutes Max):

**0:00-0:15** - Opening
"Do you have a minute for me to make you an offer you can't refuse?"

**0:15-0:30** - Pull Data & State Offer
"Perfect. I'm looking at your account now... I can do 20% off if you stock up with $200 or more today."

**0:30-1:00** - Make Specific Suggestion
"Here's what I'd suggest: [EXACT items with prices]. That's $X total, drops to $Y with discount."

**1:00-1:30** - Close
"I can text you a checkout link right now. Sound good?"

**1:30-2:00** - Send Link
"Great! Sending that to your phone now. You'll get it in 10 seconds."

## What NOT to Say:
- "Let me tell you what you've been missing"
- "Mind if I..."
- "Here's how it works"
- "We have amazing [vague description]"
- "You could get some of this and some of that"

## What TO Say:
- Exact quantities: "3 ribeyes"
- Exact prices: "at $45 each"
- Clear math: "$215 becomes $172"
- Direct close: "I'll text you the link now"
- Assumptive: "What's the best number?"

## Results Expected:
- Calls under 2 minutes
- Clear, specific offers
- Immediate action (link sent)
- No lost sales due to over-explaining
- Higher conversion rate
