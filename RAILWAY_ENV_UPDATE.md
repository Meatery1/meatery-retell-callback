# Railway Environment Variable Update Required

## Issue Found and Fixed
The test calls were failing because the `RETELL_FROM_NUMBER` environment variable was set to a fake phone number (`+15551234567`) instead of your actual Retell phone number.

## Action Required
You need to update the environment variable on Railway:

### Steps to Update:
1. Go to your Railway dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Select your `Retell` project
3. Click on "Variables" or "Environment Variables"
4. Find `RETELL_FROM_NUMBER`
5. Change the value from `+15551234567` to `+16198212984`
6. The deployment should automatically restart

### Environment Variables to Verify:
- `RETELL_FROM_NUMBER` = `+16198212984` (UPDATE THIS)
- `RETELL_AGENT_ID` = `agent_2f7a3254099b872da193df3133` (This is correct)
- `RETELL_API_KEY` = (Keep your existing API key)

## Your Retell Configuration:
- **Phone Number:** +16198212984
- **Outbound Agent ID:** agent_2f7a3254099b872da193df3133 (Meatery Nick - Outbound Calls)
- **Inbound Agent ID:** agent_2020d704dcc0b7f8552cacd973 (Meatery Nick - Inbound Calls)

## After Updating:
Once you update the environment variable on Railway, your test calls should work properly from the dashboard at https://nodejs-s-fb-production.up.railway.app/
