# ðŸ“§ Grace@TheMeatery.com Email Alias Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up Grace@TheMeatery.com as an email alias so that Grace can send discount emails from her own email address.

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. **New Email Discount Service** (`src/discount-email-service.js`)
- Replaces SMS-based discount delivery
- Sends professional HTML emails with discount codes
- Uses Grace@TheMeatery.com as the sender address
- Includes beautiful email templates with The Meatery branding

### 2. **Updated Server Configuration** (`src/server.js`)
- Switched from SMS to email for all discount deliveries
- Updated webhook handlers to use email service
- Modified agent responses to mention "email" instead of "text"

### 3. **Enhanced Email Service** (`src/email-service.js`)
- Supports custom sender addresses (Grace@TheMeatery.com)
- Automatically detects and formats sender names
- Maintains compatibility with existing email functionality

### Option 2: Gmail Forwarding (Alternative)

If you don't have Google Workspace admin access:
