# Grace Personalization Fix - Sept 2, 2025

## Problem with Call call_36fed333b0e12e0168b3f6fd9b7

Grace said **"[customer_name]"** instead of **"James"** - she wasn't accessing the dynamic variables properly and wasn't referencing actual cart items.

## Root Causes

1. **Placeholder Text Issue**: Grace was using literal placeholder text `[customer_name]` instead of dynamic variables
2. **No Specific Item Reference**: She said generic "premium wagyu" instead of referencing actual items
3. **Dynamic Variable Format**: The prompt was using `[customer_name]` instead of `{{customer_name}}`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Grace's Prompt
- Changed from `[customer_name]` to `{{customer_name}}` format
- Added `{{most_expensive_item}}` variable to reference the premium selection
- Added `{{item_suffix}}` that automatically adds " and some other goodies" for multiple items
- Clear instructions to NEVER use placeholder text

### 2. Smart Item Reference System
Grace now:
- References the **most expensive item** in the cart specifically
- Adds **"and some other goodies"** if there are multiple items
- Examples:
  - Single item: "that Japanese A5 Wagyu Ribeye"
  - Multiple items: "those 5 Japanese A5 Wagyu Filet Mignons and some other goodies"
  - Multiple types: "that premium Ribeye and some other goodies"

### 3. Enhanced Test Script
The `test-friend-call.js` now:
- Fetches real checkout data from Shopify
- Finds the most expensive item automatically
- Passes proper dynamic variables to Grace
- Shows exactly what Grace will say before calling

## How Grace Will Sound Now

**Before (Bad):**
> "Hey [customer_name], it's Grace from The Meatery. I noticed you were checking out some premium wagyu earlier..."

**After (Good):**
> "Hey James, it's Grace from The Meatery. I noticed you were checking out that Japanese A5 Wagyu Ribeye and some other goodies - great choice!"

## Dynamic Variables Grace Now Uses

- `{{customer_name}}` - Actual customer's first name
- `{{most_expensive_item}}` - The premium item to reference
- `{{item_suffix}}` - Adds " and some other goodies" if multiple items
- `{{item_count}}` - Total number of items
- `{{total_price}}` - Cart total
- `{{customer_email}}` - Customer's email (not spoken)

## Testing

Use the updated script with a real checkout ID:
```bash
# Test with real checkout data
node test-friend-call.js 14155551234 37392965861592

# Grace will now say:
# "Hey James, it's Grace from The Meatery..."
# NOT "[customer_name]"
```

## Key Improvements

1. ✅ No more placeholder text like "[customer_name]"
2. ✅ References actual items: "that Japanese A5 Wagyu Ribeye"
3. ✅ Natural multiple items: "and some other goodies"
4. ✅ Personalized with real customer data
5. ✅ Most expensive item highlighted (premium focus)

Grace now has full access to cart data and will personalize every call properly!
