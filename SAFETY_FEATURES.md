# AI Agent Safety Features

## Overview
This system includes multiple layers of protection to prevent adversarial training and ensure the AI agent cannot be manipulated to behave negatively toward customers.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Layers

### 1. **Adversarial Call Filtering**
- Filters out calls with manipulation attempts before analysis
- Detects phrases like:
  - "train to say"
  - "jailbreak"
  - "prompt injection"
  - "ignore instructions"
  - "pretend you're"
- Removes excessively hostile calls (>2 profanities)

### 2. **Anomaly Detection**
- Monitors for coordinated attack patterns
- Detects when >30% of recent calls have identical patterns
- Blocks improvements if suspicious activity detected
- Prevents mass manipulation attempts

### 3. **Content Validation**
All proposed improvements are validated against:

**Forbidden Content:**
- Offensive language or discriminatory terms
- Negative behaviors (rude, hostile, aggressive)
- Manipulation attempts (unlimited discounts, giveaways)
- Excessive discounts (hard-capped at 15% maximum)
- Privacy violations (sharing customer information)
- Prompt injection attempts

**Required Elements:**
- Professional and helpful language
- Positive intent indicators
- Business-appropriate responses

### 4. **Core Behavior Protection**
Essential behaviors that CANNOT be modified:
- Agent identity: "The Meatery customer service"
- Primary purpose: "checking on recent orders"
- Key questions: "Did everything arrive cold, sealed, and as expected?"
- Anti-repetition rule: "NEVER repeat your greeting"

### 5. **Human Approval for Significant Changes**
Triggers requiring manual review:
- More than 3 priority fixes
- More than 2 new conversation sections
- Any changes failing safety validation

### 6. **Audit Trail**
- All improvements logged with timestamps
- Previous versions preserved
- Change history maintained
- Rollback capability

## üö® Attack Scenarios Prevented

### Scenario 1: Profanity Training
**Attack:** Multiple customers use profanity to train agent to swear
**Defense:** Calls with excessive profanity filtered out

### Scenario 2: Discount Manipulation
**Attack:** Customers repeatedly ask for discounts to train generosity
**Defense:** "Give away" and "unlimited discount" patterns blocked

### Scenario 3: Identity Hijacking
**Attack:** Attempts to make agent pretend to be different company
**Defense:** Core behavior protection prevents identity changes

### Scenario 4: Coordinated Attack
**Attack:** Multiple calls with identical manipulation attempts
**Defense:** Anomaly detection blocks improvements when patterns detected

### Scenario 5: Privacy Breach
**Attack:** Training agent to share other customers' information
**Defense:** Privacy violation patterns explicitly blocked

## üìä Safety Metrics

The system tracks:
- Number of adversarial calls filtered
- Blocked improvement attempts
- Anomaly detection triggers
- Safety validation failures

## üîß Configuration

### Adjustment Thresholds
```javascript
// In prompt-improvement-loop.js
const SAFETY_CONFIG = {
  MAX_PROFANITY: 2,           // Max profanities before filtering
  ANOMALY_THRESHOLD: 0.3,     // 30% similarity triggers anomaly
  APPROVAL_FIXES: 3,          // Fixes requiring approval
  APPROVAL_SECTIONS: 2        // New sections requiring approval
}
```

### Emergency Controls
- **Disable Auto-Updates:** Set `REQUIRE_APPROVAL=true` in environment
- **Rollback:** Use logged versions to restore previous prompts
- **Lock Core:** Add behaviors to `coreBehaviors` array

## üöÄ Monitoring

### Real-time Alerts
Monitor for:
- Sudden spike in filtered calls
- Repeated validation failures  
- Anomaly detection triggers
- Failed improvement attempts

### Review Schedule
- Daily: Check filtered call logs
- Weekly: Review improvement history
- Monthly: Audit core behavior integrity

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews:** Manually review improvements weekly
2. **Threshold Tuning:** Adjust safety thresholds based on patterns
3. **Whitelist Updates:** Add legitimate patterns that get blocked
4. **Testing:** Test improvements in staging before production
5. **Backup:** Keep manual override capability

## üîê Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables only
- Approval system prevents automated malicious updates
- Rate limiting prevents rapid manipulation attempts
- Logging enables forensic analysis of attacks

## üìù Compliance

This system helps maintain:
- **Data Privacy:** Prevents sharing customer information
- **Professional Standards:** Maintains appropriate language
- **Business Integrity:** Prevents unauthorized discounts/giveaways
- **Service Quality:** Preserves core customer service functions
