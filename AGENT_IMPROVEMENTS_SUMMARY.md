# Agent Improvements Summary

## Call Analysis (Call ID: call_8b4364d100e0139ee482046e83a)

### Issues Identified:
1. **Overly Aggressive Tone**: Agent continuously interrupted customer and didn't listen to objections
2. **Inappropriate Disclosure**: Mentioned exact lifetime spending amount ($2,847) which came across as crass
3. **Price Hallucination**: Incorrectly stated A5 Wagyu Ribeye as $100 (should be $130)
4. **Poor Conversation Flow**: Talked over customer multiple times when they tried to speak
5. **Data Preloading Issues**: Used default/dummy data rather than actual customer information

## Changes Implemented:

### 1. Updated LLM Prompt (llm_2cd775883cb7fd5a638842760184)
- **Removed**: Direct mention of customer spending amounts
- **Added**: Explicit instruction to NEVER mention total_lifetime_value
- **Improved**: More professional and respectful tone throughout
- **Fixed**: Correct pricing for A5 Wagyu Ribeye ($130, discounted to $91 with 30% off)
- **Enhanced**: Better objection handling with active listening emphasis
- **Added**: Clear behavioral rules about not interrupting and respecting boundaries

### 2. Adjusted Agent Voice Settings (agent_9dfa2b728cd32e308633bfd9df)
- **Interruption Sensitivity**: 0.55 → 0.7 (less likely to interrupt)
- **Responsiveness**: 0.98 → 0.85 (more measured responses)
- **Voice Speed**: 0.98 → 0.95 (slightly slower for clarity)
- **Voice Temperature**: 0.5 → 0.65 (warmer but not aggressive)
- **Backchannel Frequency**: 0.12 → 0.08 (fewer interruptions)
- **Begin Message Delay**: 1500ms → 2000ms (more time for customer to speak first)

### 3. Updated Default Dynamic Variables
- Changed from unrealistic test data to more reasonable defaults
- Total lifetime value: $2,847 → $1,247 (though agent won't mention this)
- Favorite product: A5 Wagyu Ribeye → USDA Prime Ribeye (more common)
- Days since order: 127 → 92 (more reasonable for win-back)

## Key Script Improvements:

### Opening:
**Before**: "I can only hold it for the next 2 hours. Do you have 30 seconds?"
**After**: "I'm reaching out to our best customers with an exclusive offer - do you have a quick moment?"

### Value Proposition:
**Before**: "You've spent $2,847 with us..."
**After**: "As one of our valued customers, you know the quality we deliver..."

### Product Pricing:
**Before**: "A5 Wagyu Ribeye... around $100 for a 14-16 oz steak"
**After**: "A5 Wagyu Ribeye (14-16 oz): Regular $130, with 30% off = $91"

### Objection Handling:
**Before**: Kept pushing regardless of customer response
**After**: Active listening with specific responses for each objection type

### Tone Guidelines:
- ENTHUSIASTIC but not overwhelming
- CONFIDENT without being pushy
- PATIENT - give them time to think and respond
- RESPECTFUL - they're a valued customer, not a sales target

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Test with actual customer data**: Ensure dynamic variables are properly populated from your CRM/database
2. **Monitor interruption patterns**: Verify the agent waits for natural pauses before speaking
3. **Validate pricing accuracy**: Confirm all product prices mentioned match current website pricing
4. **Review conversation flow**: Ensure agent responds appropriately to different customer reactions
5. **Check voicemail detection**: Verify agent leaves appropriate message and ends call promptly

## Next Steps:

1. Run test calls to validate improvements
2. Monitor customer sentiment scores in post-call analysis
3. Fine-tune interruption sensitivity if needed
4. Consider A/B testing different opening approaches
5. Implement real-time product pricing lookup if possible

## Notes:
- The agent name remains "Grace" as configured
- Voice model remains "eleven_turbo_v2_5" with "11labs-Grace" voice ID
- Webhook URL remains unchanged: https://dashboard.themeatery.com/api/crm/retell/webhook
- Knowledge base IDs remain unchanged
