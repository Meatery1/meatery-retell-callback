# Grace Automation - Final Setup Complete ✅

## What's Now Configured

Your Grace automation is **fully operational** with Knowledge Base mode and enhanced learning from EVERY call.

### ✅ Grace's Knowledge Base

**KB ID**: `knowledge_base_fccce10bcd9833f1`  
**Name**: Grace KB  
**Status**: Complete  
**Documents**: 19 (from historic improvements)  
**Linked to**: Grace's LLM (`llm_330631504f69f5507c481d3447bf`)

### 🔄 Daily Automation (Runs at 2 AM)

**What it does EVERY day:**

1. **Analyzes last 24 hours** (not accumulating old calls!)
   - Gets ALL calls from yesterday
   - Fetches FULL transcripts for deep analysis
   - Reviews complete conversations, not summaries

2. **Identifies NEW patterns**:
   - Questions Grace has never received before
   - Unique objections
   - Fringe cases
   - Filters out previously addressed issues

3. **Captures POSITIVE examples**:
   - Calls marked "Positive" or "very_satisfied"
   - Successful interactions
   - Extracts as sample scripts for best practices
   - Identifies techniques that work well

4. **Updates Grace's Knowledge Base**:
   - Adds NEW issue handling (fringe cases)
   - Adds sample scripts from successful calls
   - Adds best practices observed
   - Grows ONE KB, doesn't create duplicates

5. **Preserves existing knowledge**:
   - Gets current KB content
   - Deletes old KB
   - Creates new KB with old + new content combined
   - Ensures continuous growth

## What Grace Learns From

### ❌ Negative/Failed Calls:
- New objections to handle
- Fringe cases to prepare for
- Edge scenarios to cover

### ✅ Positive/Successful Calls:
- Sample scripts showing how to handle situations well
- Best practices that lead to success
- Effective objection handling techniques
- Rapport-building patterns

### 📊 Call Analysis Details:
- **Full transcripts** reviewed (not just summaries)
- **Every single call** from last 24 hours
- **Complete context** for better learning
- **Key moments** extracted from successes

## Configuration

### Mode: Knowledge Base (Active)
```bash
USE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE=true  # ✅ Set in .env
```

### Settings:
```javascript
ANALYSIS_WINDOW_HOURS: 24          // Always last 24 hours

## What Grace Can Now Do

### Before (Prompt Mode):
- ❌ Limited by prompt size
- ❌ All context sent every call
- ❌ Only learned from failures
- ❌ No sample scripts
- ❌ Growing costs

### After (KB Mode with Positive Examples):
- ✅ Unlimited learning capacity
- ✅ Only relevant context retrieved
- ✅ Learns from successes AND failures
- ✅ Rich library of sample scripts
- ✅ Stable costs forever

## Sample Scripts Feature

When Grace encounters a situation she's seen before, she can reference successful examples:

**Example KB Document:**
```
Title: SAMPLE_SCRIPT_price_objection_handling

Customer: "That's too expensive"

Grace: "I totally understand - quality meat is an investment. 
I can offer you 10% off right now which brings it to $X. 
Plus, our customers tell us the quality and convenience 
is worth it. Would you like me to text you that discount code?"

Customer: "Yeah, that works"

Grace: "Perfect! I'm texting it to you now at [phone]. 
You'll get it in about 30 seconds. Just use code SAVE10 
at checkout."

Outcome: Customer completed order
Key moments: Validated concern, offered solution, confirmed delivery method
```

## Commands

### Daily Automation (Automatic):
```bash
# Runs at 2 AM via cron
