# üì± Discount Code SMS Integration Setup

## Overview
This system allows your Retell AI agent to create Shopify discount codes and text them to customers in real-time during calls.

## üöÄ Features
- **Real-time discount generation** - Agent creates unique codes on demand
- **SMS delivery** - Codes texted instantly to customer's phone
- **Eligibility checking** - Prevents abuse by checking recent discount usage
- **Automatic tracking** - Discounts logged in Shopify order notes
- **Smart authorization** - Agent knows when to offer discounts

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Shopify Admin API Access
You need a Shopify Admin API token with these permissions:
- `write_price_rules` - Create discount codes
- `write_discounts` - Manage discounts
- `read_customers` - Check customer history
- `write_orders` - Add notes to orders

### 2. Twilio Account
Sign up at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com) and get:
- Account SID
- Auth Token
- Phone number for sending SMS

### 3. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Shopify Configuration
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+15551234567

# Retell Configuration
RETELL_API_KEY=your_retell_api_key
RETELL_AGENT_ID=agent_566475088bf8231175ddfb1899
```

## üîß Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Deploy your server:**
```bash
npm start
```

3. **Update webhook URL in Retell:**
Make sure your agent's webhook is set to:
```
https://your-server.com/webhooks/retell
```

## üí¨ How It Works

### Agent Conversation Flow

1. **Customer asks for discount:**
   - Customer: "Do you have any discounts?"
   - Agent: "Since you're a valued customer, I can text you a 10% off code. Can you confirm your phone number?"

2. **Service recovery scenario:**
   - Customer: "My steak wasn't frozen"
   - Agent: "I'm sorry about that. Let me make this right with a 10% discount code..."

3. **Agent sends the code:**
   - Agent confirms phone number
   - Sets internal flag: `send_discount_sms=true`
   - Webhook triggers SMS sending
   - Customer receives text within seconds

### Discount Code Format
```
MEATERY10OFFABC123
```
- Prefix: MEATERY
- Value: 10OFF
- Unique suffix: ABC123

### SMS Message Template
```

```

- Valued customers ($500+ spent): 12% off

## üìä Tracking & Analytics

### Shopify Order Notes
Automatically added:
```
Discount sent via SMS: MEATERY10OFFABC123 (10% off)
```

### Post-Call Analysis
Tracks:
- `send_discount_sms`: Whether discount was offered
- `discount_value`: Percentage given (10, 15, 20)
- `discount_reason`: Why it was offered
- `customer_phone`: Where SMS was sent

## üéØ Agent Authorization

The agent is authorized to offer discounts for:
1. **Service recovery** - When there's a problem with the order
2. **Customer retention** - When customer threatens to cancel
3. **Direct requests** - When customer asks for a discount
4. **Valued customers** - As a thank you (use sparingly)

## üß™ Testing

### Test the SMS endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/send-discount \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_phone": "5551234567",
    "customer_name": "Test Customer",
    "discount_value": 10,
    "reason": "testing"
  }'
```

### Test eligibility check:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/check-discount-eligibility \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_phone": "5551234567"
  }'
```
