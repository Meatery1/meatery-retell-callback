   - Sign in as hello@themeatery.com

   - Copy the 16-character code
3. **Update .env** with the app password

## üéØ Current System Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Retell Agent | ‚úÖ Ready | Tools configured, prompt updated |
| Server Endpoints | ‚úÖ Ready | All endpoints working |
| Shopify Integration | ‚úÖ Ready | Connected to your store |
| Email Templates | ‚úÖ Ready | Professional HTML/text format |
| Email Sending | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Config | Just add SMTP password |
| Customer CC Logic | ‚úÖ Ready | Auto-checks Shopify for email |

## üìß How The Email System Works

1. **Customer reports issue** ‚Üí Agent calls refund/replacement tool
2. **Tool checks Shopify** for customer email (99% have it)
3. **If email found**: Sends ticket, CCs customer automatically
4. **If email missing**: Sends ticket with warning, agent asks for email
5. **Commslayer receives** professional HTML ticket at hello@themeatery.com

## üîê Security Notes

- Never commit the `.env` file to git
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Keep backup of your credentials separately
- Rotate API keys periodically

## üí° Final Note

Your system is **completely ready** - it just needs the Gmail app password to start sending emails. Everything else from your long list is for other projects/dashboards and not needed here.
