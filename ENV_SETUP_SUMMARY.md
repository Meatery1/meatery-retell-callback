## ‚ùå NOT Needed from Your List

All these can be ignored for this project:
- `ALSOASKED_API_KEY` - Not used
- `ANTHROPIC_*` - Claude API (not used)
- `AUTH_*` - Dashboard auth (not used)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL (not used)

## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps

1. **Create .env file** with only the needed variables
2. **Ensure Google Service Account is configured**:
   - Service account should already exist: `meatery-dashboard@theta-voyager-423706-t9.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Private key should be available in your environment
   - Domain-wide delegation should be set up for Gmail
3. **Update .env** with the service account credentials
4. **Test**: `node test-email-tickets.js`

## üéØ Current System Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Retell Agent | ‚úÖ Ready | Tools configured, prompt updated |
| Server Endpoints | ‚úÖ Ready | All endpoints working |
| Shopify Integration | ‚úÖ Ready | Connected to your store |
| Email Templates | ‚úÖ Ready | Professional HTML/text format |
| Email Sending | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Config | Just add service account credentials |
| Customer CC Logic | ‚úÖ Ready | Auto-checks Shopify for email |

## üìß How The Email System Works

1. **Customer reports issue** ‚Üí Agent calls refund/replacement tool
2. **Tool checks Shopify** for customer email (99% have it)
3. **If email found**: Sends ticket, CCs both nicholas@themeatery.com and customer automatically
4. **If email missing**: Sends ticket with warning to nicholas@themeatery.com, agent asks for email
5. **Commslayer receives** professional HTML ticket at hello@themeatery.com

## üîê Security Notes

- Never commit the `.env` file to git
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Keep backup of your credentials separately
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Google Service Account provides secure, token-based authentication

## üí° Final Note

Your system is **completely ready** - it just needs the Google Service Account credentials to start sending emails. The SMTP integration has been removed in favor of the more secure and reliable Google Service Account approach.
