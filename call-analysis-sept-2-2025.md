### Issues:
1. **DOUBLE MESSAGE IN VOICEMAIL** - Grace left TWO messages in the same voicemail!
2. **EMAIL REFERENCE IN VOICEMAIL** - She said "reply to the email I sent you" in a voicemail
3. **TOO LONG** - 61 seconds for a voicemail is excessive

### Transcript:
```
User: Hello?

Agent: "Hey Stella, it's Grace from The Meatery. I noticed you were looking at 1 Japanese A5 Wagyu | Ground Beef, 2 Japanese A5 Wagyu | Denver Steak I BMS 11 | 8oz, 2 Japanese A5 Wagyu | Kagoshima | Filet Mignon I BMS 9 | 8oz, 1 SavedBy Package Protection, 1 American Wagyu | Wagyu Hot Dogs | 1LB on our site earlier - that's such a great choice! What happened? Did you run into any issues with the checkout, or were you just not quite ready to pull the trigger on that?"
```

### Issues:
1. **QUOTES IN SPEECH** - The agent literally said quotes at the beginning
2. **OVERWHELMING PRODUCT LIST** - Listed EVERY single item including quantities and full product names
3. **TOO ROBOTIC** - Sounds like reading from a script
4. **IMMEDIATE HANGUP** - User hung up after this overwhelming intro

---

## CRITICAL PROBLEMS TO FIX:

1. **Voicemail Handling:** Grace needs to leave ONE short message and END THE CALL
2. **Product Mention:** Should NOT list every item - just say "your premium wagyu selections" or similar
3. **Formatting Issues:** Remove any quotes or special characters from speech
4. **Conversational Tone:** Too robotic and scripted - needs to be more natural
5. **Opening Too Long:** Get to the point faster
