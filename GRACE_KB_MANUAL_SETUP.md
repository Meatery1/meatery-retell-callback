**Your Grace agent:**

- LLM ID: `llm_330631504f69f5507c481d3447bf`

- Saved to: `./core-prompts/agent_e2636fcbe1c89a7f6bd0731e11_current_prompt.txt`

## Issue: Retell SDK Limitation

The Retell Node.js SDK doesn't currently expose the Knowledge Base API. This means we need to either:

### Option 1: Wait for SDK Update (Recommended for automation)
- Contact Retell support to add KB API to SDK
- Once available, run: `npm run kb:build-grace`
- System will automatically create and populate KB

### Option 2: Manual KB Creation (Works Now)

**Step 1: Create KB in Retell Dashboard**
1. Go to Retell dashboard ‚Üí Knowledge Bases
2. Click "Create Knowledge Base"
3. Name: "Grace - Fringe Cases & Learnings"
4. Add the documents below manually

**Step 2: Link to Grace's LLM**
1. Go to your LLM configuration
2. Add the Knowledge Base ID to `knowledge_base_ids` array
3. Save

**Step 3: Add These 17 Documents**

I'll generate the complete document set for you...

## Option 3: Use Prompt Mode for Now

Since KB API isn't ready, you can continue with prompt mode (which is working great):

```bash
# Current system works well with prompt mode
npm run improve

# When SDK is updated, switch to:
USE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE=true npm run improve
```

## What You're Saving vs What You're Building

**Current prompt bloat path:**
- Start: 13,738 chars (3,435 tokens)
- After 30 more improvements: ~25,000 chars (6,250 tokens)
- Cost per call: $0.06 ‚Üí $0.15

**KB path (when available):**
- Core prompt: ~2,500 tokens
- KB: Unlimited documents
- Cost per call: ~$0.04 (stable)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Keep using prompt mode (it's working!)
2. **Monitor**: Watch for Retell SDK KB support
3. **When ready**: Run `npm run kb:build-grace` to auto-migrate
4. **Alternative**: I can generate all 17 documents in a format you can copy-paste into Retell dashboard

**Would you like me to:**
A. Generate the 17 documents ready for manual upload?
B. Contact Retell to add KB API support?
C. Keep using prompt mode until SDK is ready?

Let me know and I'll help you get this set up! üöÄ
