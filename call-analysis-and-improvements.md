2. **Objection Handling**: Excellent response to cooking concerns with simple instructions
3. **Discount Offers**: Successfully offering 10% discounts
4. **Friendly Tone**: Natural, conversational style

## ðŸ”´ Problems to Fix

### 1. **DEFAULTS TO EMAIL INSTEAD OF TEXT**
- Grace says: "I can email you a 10% off discount code"
- Should say: "I can text you a 10% off discount code right now"
- Texts have 98% open rate vs 20% for email!

### 2. **REPETITIVE PRODUCT MENTIONS**
- Said "that Japanese A5 Wagyu" 4-5 times per call
- Should vary: "it", "your selection", "those steaks"

### 3. **QUOTE FORMATTING ISSUE**
- First line started with quotes: `"Hey James..."`
- Should not have any quotes in speech

### 4. **MISSING URGENCY/SCARCITY**
- No mention of limited availability
- No time-sensitive offers
- No FOMO creation

### 5. **WEAK CLOSING**
- Doesn't ask for the order directly
- Should guide to complete checkout immediately

## ðŸ’¡ Conversion Rate Improvements

### 1. **Text First, Email Backup**
```
Current: "I can email you a 10% off discount"
Better: "I can text you a 10% off code right now - you'll have it in seconds. What's the best number to text you at?"
```

### 2. **Create Urgency**
```
Add: "Just so you know, we only have a few of these left in stock, and they've been moving fast this week."
```

### 3. **Direct Call-to-Action**
```
Current: "Let me know if you need any help"
Better: "Can I help you complete your order right now while I have the discount ready?"
```

### 4. **Vary Product References**
- First mention: "that Japanese A5 Wagyu"
- Second mention: "it" or "your selection"
- Third mention: "those premium cuts"

### 5. **Handle Common Objections Proactively**
```
For price: "I know it's an investment, but our customers say it's the best steak they've ever had - and with 10% off, it's a great time to try it."

For cooking: "Don't worry, it's easier than you think - just a quick sear, and I can even send you our foolproof cooking guide."

For timing: "We can ship it out today for delivery by [day]."
```

### 6. **Stronger Opening Hook**
```
Current: "What happened? Did you run into any issues?"
Better: "I saw you were just about to grab those - was it the price, or were you comparing options?"
```

## ðŸ“± SMS vs Email Statistics

- **SMS Open Rate**: 98% within 3 minutes
- **Email Open Rate**: 20% within 24 hours
- **SMS Conversion**: 45% higher than email

2. **Fallback option**: Email only if no phone number
3. **Urgency language**: Include scarcity and time limits
4. **Direct closing**: Ask for the order
5. **Product variety**: Don't repeat the same product name
