# Shopify Integration Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis (Call ID: call_749e44eb157dd6c9d4713461895)

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Tool Was Working**: The agent successfully called `get_customer_order_history` and received real Shopify data
2. **Data Not Being Used**: Despite getting Order #29612 from "2024-10-17", the agent still said "92 days ago"
3. **Wrong Time Calculation**: October 17, 2024 to January 2025 is ~3 months, NOT 92 days
4. **Tool Not Documented**: The LLM prompt didn't document the `get_customer_order_history` tool
5. **Mixing Real and Fake Data**: Agent used real order number but fake time period

## Root Cause:
The tools are configured on your webhook server (dashboard.themeatery.com), NOT in the Retell LLM configuration. The agent could call the tools but didn't know how to properly use the response data because:
- The tool wasn't documented in the prompt
- The agent didn't know to override dynamic variables with real data
- No instructions on proper date calculation

## Solution Implemented:

### 1. Updated LLM Prompt (llm_2cd775883cb7fd5a638842760184)
- **Added Tool Documentation**: Explicitly documented all three available tools
- **Critical Data Rules**: Clear instructions to ALWAYS use tool response data over placeholders
- **Date Calculation Guide**: Specific examples of how to calculate time differences correctly
- **Error Handling**: Instructions for when customers correct the agent

### 2. Key Changes to Agent Behavior:
```
BEFORE: "It's been 92 days since your last order" (using placeholder)
AFTER: "Your order #29612 was on October 17th, 2024, about 3 months ago" (using real data)
```

### 3. New Data Handling Rules:
1. When customer asks about orders → IMMEDIATELY call get_customer_order_history
2. Use EXACT dates from response (e.g., "2024-10-17" → "October 17th, 2024")
3. Calculate real time difference (Oct 2024 to Jan 2025 = ~3 months, NOT 92 days)
4. Never mix tool data with dynamic variables

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Agent calls get_customer_order_history when asked about orders
- [ ] Agent uses actual order dates from tool response
- [ ] Agent calculates time correctly (months, not placeholder days)
- [ ] Agent references correct order numbers and items
- [ ] Agent admits mistakes gracefully if corrected

## Example Correct Conversation:
```
Customer: "What did I order 92 days ago?"
Agent: "Let me pull up your order history right now..."
[Calls get_customer_order_history]
Agent: "Your order #29612 was placed on October 17th, 2024, which was about 3 months ago. 
        That order included the 7 Sins BBQ All Purpose Rub."
```

## Note on Tool Configuration:
The tools (`get_customer_order_history`, `send_discount_code`, `send_winback_draft_order`) are configured on your webhook server at dashboard.themeatery.com, not in the Retell configuration. This is why we couldn't add them directly to the LLM's general_tools field - they're already available via the webhook.

## Next Steps:
1. Test the agent with a new call
2. Verify it properly uses Shopify data
3. Monitor that date calculations are accurate
4. Check that the agent doesn't mention customer spending amounts
