# Klaviyo Events API Integration - FIXED ✅

## Summary
Successfully reverted from the broken Campaign API to the **working Events API** approach and fixed Shopify GraphQL integration to properly fetch abandoned checkout URLs.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Shopify GraphQL Queries** ✅
- Fixed schema errors (removed invalid fields like `closedAt`, `currencyCode`, etc.)
- Updated to use `abandonmentByAbandonedCheckoutId` for fetching by ID
- Properly extracts `abandonedCheckoutUrl` from Shopify

### 2. **Events API Integration** ✅
- Reverted to Events API which was **already working** ("Holy shit, it's actually working!")
- Properly appends discount codes to checkout URLs
- Includes UTM tracking parameters
- Handles both email and SMS channels

### 3. **Server Integration** ✅
- Updated `server.js` to use `klaviyo-events-integration.js`
- Passes `abandonedCheckoutId` from webhook to Klaviyo functions
- Automatically determines preferred channel (SMS vs email)

## Key Files

### New/Updated Files:
- `src/klaviyo-events-service.js` - Events API implementation (WORKING)
- `src/klaviyo-events-integration.js` - Main integration with Shopify
- `src/shopify-graphql-queries.js` - Fixed GraphQL queries

### Deprecated (DO NOT USE):
- `src/klaviyo-email-service-fixed.js` - Campaign API (keeps failing)
- `src/klaviyo-email-service.js` - Original broken Campaign API

## How It Works

1. **Grace AI calls webhook** with abandoned checkout info
2. **Server fetches actual checkout URL** from Shopify using fixed GraphQL
3. **Discount code appended** to checkout URL with UTM parameters
4. **Events API triggers** Klaviyo Flow for immediate delivery

## Example URL Generated:
```
https://themeatery.com/checkout?discount=GRACE555517&utm_source=grace_ai&utm_medium=sms&utm_campaign=abandoned_cart_recovery
```

## Events API Advantages:
- ✅ No "Queued without Recipients" issues
- ✅ Immediate delivery
- ✅ Works with existing subscribed profiles
- ✅ No list management needed
- ✅ Designed for transactional messages

## Next Steps:
1. **Configure Klaviyo Flow** for "Grace Discount Offered" event
2. Add email/SMS templates to the flow
3. Set flow to Live status

## Testing Commands:
```bash
# Test Events API (WORKING)
node test-klaviyo-events.js

# Test abandoned checkout integration
node test-abandoned-checkout-recovery.js
```

## Important Notes:
- **ALWAYS use Events API** for transactional messages
- Campaign API is for bulk marketing only
- Discount codes auto-append to checkout URLs
- Works with real Shopify abandoned checkout data
